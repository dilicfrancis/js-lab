USER node
#By default, the Docker Node image includes a non-root node user that you can use to avoid running your application container as root. It is a recommended security practice to avoid running containers as root and to restrict capabilities within the container to only those required to run its processes. We will therefore use the node userâ€™s home directory as the working directory for our application and set them as our user inside the container.

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app
WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY --chown=node:node ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY --chown=node:node ./ ./

CMD ["npm", "start"]
